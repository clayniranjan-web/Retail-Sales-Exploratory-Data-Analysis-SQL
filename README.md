## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a retail bike store database built entirely using **Microsoft SQL Server**. The goal is to explore, understand, and extract meaningful business insights from raw sales data — covering customers, products, and transactions spanning **7 years (2018–2024)** across **25 countries**.

This project demonstrates the ability to think like a data analyst — not just writing SQL queries, but asking the right business questions and deriving actionable insights from data.
